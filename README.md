# WallJumpers
Mobile Game Design - 2017

<p>
{Description edit 2-4-2022}

WallJumpers is a mobile game built natively for iOS using SpriteKit. This application was created as a project for my Mobile Game Design class at Full Sail University. Since submitting the project and passing that class, I have stopped development for WallJumpers. After recent cleaning of my repositories on GitHub, I decided to keep this project here as a memory to look back on during my time in college. I hope to maybe pick up on this idea again in the future during my free time.
